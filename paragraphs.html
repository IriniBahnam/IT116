   <h1>Egypt</h1> <br>
        <p>Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, 
            tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to the 6th–4th 
            millennia BCE. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt
            saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, 
            urbanisation, organised religion and central government.[15] 
            Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great 
            Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the 
            Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a 
            significant focus of scientific and popular interest. </p>

   <h2>History</h2>
        <p>There is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces 
            and in desert oases. In the 10th millennium BCE, a culture 
            of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding 
            culture. Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to
            desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara. Early 
            tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a 
            settled agricultural economy and more centralised society.[30]</p>

    <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>Most of Egypt's rain falls in the winter months.[120] South of
             Cairo, rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in)
              per year and at intervals of many years. On a very thin strip 
              of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm 
            (16.1 in),[121] mostly between October and March.</p>

    <h4>Law</h4>
        <p>The legal system is based on Islamic and civil law 
            (particularly Napoleonic codes); and judicial review by a 
            Supreme Court, which accepts compulsory International Court 
            of Justice jurisdiction only with reservations.[57]</p>

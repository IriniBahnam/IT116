       <p>Shrek	and	Donkey	go	and	rescue	the	Princess,	narrowly	avoiding	being	burned	by	
        the	Dragon,	who	tries	to	seduce	Donkey	(being	a	girl	Dragon!).	Fiona	is	disgruntled	
        about	being	rescued	by	an	ugly	ogre,	rather	than	Prince	Charming.	However,	despite	
        their	differences,	she	and	Shrek	grow	fond	of	each	other.	</p>
